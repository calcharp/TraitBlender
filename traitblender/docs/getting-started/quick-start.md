# Quick Start Guide (GUI)

Get up and running with TraitBlender's graphical interface in just a few minutes! This guide will walk you through creating your first museum-style specimen image using Blender's user interface.

!!! note "Alternative Access Methods"
    This guide covers the GUI interface. TraitBlender can also be accessed programmatically via Python API. See the [Quick Start (API)](./quick-start-api.md) guide for code-based workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- ✅ Blender 4.3.0+ installed
- ✅ TraitBlender add-on installed ([Installation Guide](./installation.md))

??? note "Step 1: Enable TraitBlender"
    1. Open Blender
    2. Go to **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons**
    3. Search for "TraitBlender" 
    4. Enable the checkbox next to **TraitBlender**
    5. The TraitBlender panel should now appear in the **3D Viewport sidebar** (press `N` if hidden)

    If you want TraitBlender to be activated by default when opening Blender, you must save your preferences after activation with **Edit → ☰ → Save Preferences**.

??? note "Step 2: Open the Museum Scene"
    1. In the TraitBlender panel, find the **"1 Museum Setup"** panel
    2. Click the **"Import Museum"** button
    3. After a moment, the scene will load with a museum table, lighting, and camera setup
    4. Press `0` on your numpad (or `0` with Emulate Numpad enabled) to switch to Camera View
    5. You should now be looking through the camera at the empty mat lying on the table

    !!! tip "Emulate Numpad"
        If you don't have a numpad, go to **Edit → Preferences → Input** and check **Emulate Numpad**. This allows you to use the number keys at the top of your keyboard as a numpad.

??? note "Step 3: Configure the Scene"
    Collapse the **Museum Setup** panel and expand the **"2 Configuration"** panel.

    The configuration system stores all scene settings (camera, lighting, world, materials, etc.) as a structured PropertyGroup at `bpy.context.scene.traitblender_config`. The Configuration Panel provides a visual interface for these settings.

    In this panel, you'll see several collapsible sections:

    - **World** - Background color and lighting strength
    - **Camera** - Position, rotation, focal length, resolution
    - **Lamp** - Lighting position, color, power, and properties
    - **Mat** - Specimen mat color, position, and scale
    - **Render** - Render engine settings
    - **Output** - Image output format and directory
    - **Metadata** - Information to include in rendered images

    Click the arrow next to any section to expand it and adjust settings. Changes are immediately reflected in the scene.

    ### Viewing and Exporting Configuration

    - **Show Configuration**: Click this button to see all configuration values in a popup window
    - **Export Config as YAML**: Export your current configuration to a YAML file for reuse

    ### Importing Configuration

    1. In the **Museum Setup** panel, enter a path to a YAML config file in the **Config File** field
    2. Click **Configure Scene** to load the configuration

    !!! warning "Scene Requirements"
        Configuration import only works if the museum scene has been loaded (via **Import Museum**). If you encounter issues, click **Clear Scene** and re-import the museum scene.

??? note "Step 4: Select a Morphospace"
    Expand the **"3 Morphospaces"** panel.

    TraitBlender generates 3D specimens from mathematical models called morphospaces. By default, TraitBlender includes the **CO_Raup** morphospace, which combines:
    - The morphospace developed by [Contreras-Figueroa and Aragón](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/15/3/431) (a generalization of Raup's classic shell space)
    - [Okabe and Yoshimura's](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep42445) allometric shell thickness function

    This creates fully 3D models of molluscan shells with realistic geometry.

    Select **CO_Raup** from the dropdown (it should be the only option by default).

??? note "Step 5: Import and Manage Datasets"
    Expand the **"4 Datasets"** panel.

    ### Import a Dataset

    1. Click the folder icon next to **Dataset File**
    2. Select a CSV, TSV, or Excel (.xlsx, .xls) file containing your morphological data
    3. TraitBlender will automatically:
       - Detect the species/label column (looks for: species, label, tips, name, id, etc.)
       - Move the species column to the first position
       - Load the data into the system

    ### Dataset Format

    Your dataset should have:
    - **First column**: Species/specimen names (automatically detected)
    - **Remaining columns**: Morphological traits that map to morphospace parameters

    For CO_Raup, the parameters include: `b`, `d`, `z`, `a`, `phi`, `psi`, `c_depth`, `c_n`, `n_depth`, `n`, `t`, `time_step`, `points_in_circle`, `eps`, `h_0`, `length`

    ### Generate a Specimen

    1. After importing, select a specimen from the **Sample** dropdown
    2. Click **Generate Sample**
    3. A 3D shell will be generated and placed at the center of the table
    4. Use the **Sample Controls** section to adjust the specimen's position and rotation

    ### Edit Dataset

    Click **Edit Dataset** to open the CSV viewer (DearPyGui). This allows you to:
    - View and filter your data
    - Sort by columns
    - Edit values
    - Export changes back to TraitBlender

??? note "Step 6: Orientations"
    Expand the **"5 Orientations"** panel.

    Each morphospace can define orientation functions in its `ORIENTATIONS` dictionary. Select an orientation from the dropdown and click **Apply** to orient the specimen. The selected orientation is also applied automatically when running the Imaging Pipeline.

??? note "Step 7: Configure Transforms"
    Expand the **"6 Transforms"** panel.

    Transforms allow you to add statistical variation to your images for data augmentation. This is useful for training neural networks or simulating real-world imaging conditions.

    ### Building a Transform Pipeline

    1. **Select Property**: Choose a configuration section (e.g., "world") and a property (e.g., "color")
    2. **Select Sampler**: Choose a statistical distribution (uniform, normal, beta, gamma, etc.)
    3. **Add Transform**: The transform is added to the pipeline (currently requires Python API - GUI coming soon)

    ### Available Samplers

    - **uniform**: Uniform distribution between low and high
    - **normal**: Normal (Gaussian) distribution
    - **beta**: Beta distribution
    - **gamma**: Gamma distribution
    - **dirichlet**: Dirichlet distribution (for color vectors)
    - **multivariate_normal**: Multivariate normal distribution
    - **poisson**: Poisson distribution
    - **exponential**: Exponential distribution
    - **cauchy**: Cauchy distribution
    - **discrete_uniform**: Discrete uniform distribution

    ### Running the Pipeline

    - **Run Pipeline**: Execute all transforms in sequence
    - **Undo Pipeline**: Revert all changes back to original values


??? note "Step 8: Render Images"
    Expand the **"7 Imaging"** panel.

    1. Configure your output settings in the **Configuration** panel (Output section)
    2. Click **Run Imaging Pipeline** to render images

    The imaging pipeline will:
    - Apply any configured transforms
    - Render from the current camera view
    - Save images to the specified output directory
    - Include metadata if configured

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've completed the basic workflow. Now you can:

- **Customize Configurations**: Create and save YAML configs for different imaging setups
- **Build Transform Pipelines**: Use the Python API to create complex data augmentation pipelines
- **Work with Multiple Specimens**: Process entire datasets programmatically
