✅ COMPLETED:
- Transforms GUI fully set up
- Interactive dataset editor working
- TransformPipelineConfig undo functionality fixed
- Imaging pipeline operator implemented (timer-based batch rendering)

---

🚧 IN PROGRESS:
- Orientations system (rotation origin functionality needs implementation)
- Hyperparameters system testing: Need to rebuild package and import into Blender to verify changes didn't break anything (use_inner_surface, points_in_circle, time_step moved to HYPERPARAMETERS dict)

---

Future enhancements and new features can be added below:
- Get Transforms more fully fleshed out.
- Make a plan (even if its not completed) for how to make the sampling go faster for the shell morphospace
- Better integration with HPCs
- Morphospace hyperparameters system: Add support for distinguishing biological traits from hyperparameters (e.g., points_in_circle, time_step, inner/outer surface flag). These should be configurable separately from dataset traits and have sensible defaults.



- Make documentation building work
